	abstract="Queries submitted to a retrieval system are often ambiguous. In such a situation, a sensible strategy is to diversify the ranking of results to be retrieved, in the hope that users will find at least one of these results to be relevant to their information need. In this paper, we introduce xQuAD, a novel framework for search result diversification that builds such a diversified ranking by explicitly accounting for the relationship between documents retrieved for the original query and the possible aspects underlying this query, in the form of sub-queries. We evaluate the effectiveness of xQuAD using a standard TREC collection. The results show that our framework markedly outperforms state-of-the-art diversification approaches under a simulated best-case scenario. Moreover, we show that its effectiveness can be further improved by estimating the relative importance of each identified sub-query. Finally, we show that our framework can still outperform the simulated best-case scenario of the state-of-the-art diversification approaches using sub-queries automatically derived from the baseline document ranking itself.",

	ABSTRACT = {“Public legal information from all countries and international institutions is part of the common heritage of humanity. Maximizing access to this information promotes justice and the rule of law”. In accordance with the aforementioned declaration on free access to law by legal information institutes of the world, a plethora of legal information is available through the Internet, while the provision of legal information has never before been easier. Given that law is accessed by a much wider group of people, the majority of whom are not legally trained or qualified, diversification techniques should be employed in the context of legal information retrieval, as to increase user satisfaction. We address the diversification of results in legal search by adopting several state of the art methods from the web search, network analysis and text summarization domains. We provide an exhaustive evaluation of the methods, using a standard dataset from the common law domain that we objectively annotated with relevance judgments for this purpose. Our results: (i) reveal that users receive broader insights across the results they get from a legal information retrieval system; (ii) demonstrate that web search diversification techniques outperform other approaches (e.g., summarization-based, graph-based methods) in the context of legal diversification; and (iii) offer balance boundaries between reinforcing relevant documents or sampling the information space around the legal query.},
